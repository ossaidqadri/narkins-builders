## What Seasoned Investors Are Telling Us

From actual conversations with our clients:

*"I sold my house in Phase 8 and bought two apartment units. The rental income from apartments is double what I was getting from the house, and I sleep better knowing everything is managed professionally."* - Property investor, 3-year apartment owner

*"The maintenance headache was killing me. Every month something needed fixing in the house. Now I just get a rent check and everything else is handled."* - Apartment investor

## Why This Actually Matters

Here's what nobody talks about: **time and stress costs**.

With an independent house, you're essentially running a small facility management business. You're dealing with:
* Finding and managing security guards
* Generator breakdowns at 2 AM  
* Plumbing issues during Eid holidays
* Garden maintenance during monsoon season
* Negotiating with multiple service providers

With professional apartment management, you make one phone call to building management. That's it.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

After 30 years in this business, we've seen thousands of investors make both choices. Here's what the data shows:

**Apartment owners:**
* Spend 90% less time on property management
* Have 35% higher rental yields
* Face 60% lower annual maintenance costs
* Experience higher occupancy rates vs independent houses

**House owners:**
* Spend 15-20 hours monthly on property issues
* Deal with vacancy periods of 2-4 months annually
* Handle 3-5 major maintenance issues yearly
* Pay 40-60% more in total ownership costs

## Here's What You Should Do
