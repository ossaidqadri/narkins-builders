A software engineer from Peshawar accepts a Karachi tech job at triple his hometown salary. He arrives and asks: "Where will I live?"

That question, repeated across Pakistani tech companies, has triggered a revolution. Companies aren't helping staff find scattered rentals. They're buying apartments in bulk.

## Why Companies Are Buying Apartments

Careem operates 3,000+ employees in Karachi. TikTok scaled to 500+ staff. Yet the Pakistan Software Houses Association reports tech companies lose 22% of talent within 6 months due to housing.

Furnished rentals cost 150,000-250,000 rupees monthly, scattered across the city. Rather than lose talent, 12 major tech entities purchased bulk apartments. TikTok Pakistan secured 80+ units in Bahria Town.

An 80-lakh apartment becomes appreciating asset. Companies need centralized management, standardized quality, and security—provided by [luxury apartments with security Karachi](/blog/2025/11/hill-crest-residency-begins-possession-handover-owners-november-2025).
