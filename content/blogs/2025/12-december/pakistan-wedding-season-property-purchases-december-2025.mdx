When December arrives, Pakistan's real estate market experiences something no investment trend can match: the wedding boom. While analysts focus on FBR policies, the real driver sits in wedding halls—a father signing apartment papers for his daughter's married life.

Pakistan conducts 340,000 weddings annually, October-January. Each triggers property decisions: newlyweds need apartments; parents buy gifts. Wedding-driven demand moves more units than any financial policy.

Unlike investment buyers, wedding families make emotional decisions. A father asks: "Which apartment is safe? Can my daughter occupy it immediately?"

This drives family apartments Bahria Town Karachi. Graana.com data shows 34% of December apartment inquiries come from families buying for newlyweds, versus 12% from investors—nearly 3x more traffic.
