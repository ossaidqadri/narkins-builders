## Faysal Quraishi's Personal Invitation

In his video message to Bahria Town residents, Faysal Quraishi announced the opening:

"Good news for Bahria Town: Narkin's X FQ Faysal Quraishi Collection—our store is opening on November 22nd in Bahria Town. If you live in Bahria Town, I request that you all please visit. We have Narkin's, Narmin, and the Faysal Quraishi Collection—lots of new collections have arrived. When you come and see for yourself, you will realize what an amazing collection has arrived. We have both stitched and unstitched options."

For those unfamiliar, Faysal Quraishi holds over 20 national awards and is widely regarded as one of Pakistan's finest actors. His work in Bashar Momin—the first Pakistani drama to air on Indian television—cemented his status as an industry icon. He also hosts Khush Raho Pakistan on BOL TV.

When someone of this caliber personally promotes a store opening, the location matters.

## The FQ Collection at Narkin's

The Faysal Quraishi Collection launched in March 2024 through a collaboration with Narkin's Textile at Koel Cafe Karachi. The collection offers luxury ethnic wear—premium shalwar kameez and waistcoats designed with sophistication for modern Pakistani men.

Narkin's Textile operates a nationwide network of over 5,000 retailers and brand outlets across Pakistan. The decision to open a flagship store at Hill Crest Residency Bahria Town signals confidence in the location's commercial viability and foot traffic.

## Why Hill Crest Residency for a Flagship Store

Retailers don't open flagship outlets in empty buildings. They choose locations with:

**Established foot traffic** — HCR residents already moving in, visitors exploring the building, potential buyers touring units. The [possession handover ceremony began November 5](/blog/2025/11/hill-crest-residency-begins-possession-handover-owners-november-2025), meaning the building has active residents.

**Premium demographics** — Buyers of best apartments in Bahria Town Karachi represent purchasing power. They're the exact demographic luxury ethnic wear brands target.

**Prime location** — 29-A Main Jinnah Avenue puts the store on one of Bahria Town's most prominent addresses. Jinnah Avenue apartments Bahria Town benefit from this commercial activity at ground level.

**Security and environment** — Gated community apartments Bahria Town offer the safe, upscale environment premium retailers require.

The store opening validates what [HCR's completion certificate already proved](/blog/2025/10/hill-crest-residency-completion-certificate-ready-apartments-bahria-town-october-2025)—this building delivers on promises and attracts serious commercial interest.

## What This Means for HCR Residents and Buyers

For current owners receiving possession of ready apartments Bahria Town Karachi, having premium retail at ground level adds immediate lifestyle value. No need to drive across town for quality clothing—it's in your building.

For prospective buyers evaluating apartments near me Bahria Town Karachi, this demonstrates HCR isn't just residential. It's becoming a mixed-use destination where living, shopping, and lifestyle converge.

For investors, retail tenants paying commercial rents in the building add another revenue dimension beyond residential units. Premium tenants like Narkin's—with celebrity-backed collections—signal the building's commercial attractiveness.

## The Narkin's Family Business Synergy

There's something fitting about Narkin's Textile opening inside a Narkin's Builders property. The family business group spans construction and textiles—two pillars of Pakistan's economy. When the textile arm chooses the construction arm's building for a flagship store featuring a celebrity collaboration, that's internal confidence backed by external validation.

Best builders in Bahria Town Karachi don't just construct buildings. They create ecosystems where residential, commercial, and lifestyle elements integrate. Hill Crest Residency exemplifies this approach.

## Beyond the Store Opening

This launch represents more than retail expansion. It demonstrates that completed projects Bahria Town attract serious commercial tenants—brands with celebrity partnerships, national distribution networks, and premium positioning.

For anyone researching luxury apartments with security Karachi or evaluating where to buy in Bahria Town, the question isn't just about the apartment. It's about what surrounds it. Hill Crest Residency now includes flagship retail from one of Pakistan's most recognized textile brands, endorsed by one of the country's most awarded actors.

That's the difference between buildings that exist and buildings that thrive.
