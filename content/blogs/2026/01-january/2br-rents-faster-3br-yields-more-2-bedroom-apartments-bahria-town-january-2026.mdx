You're standing in **Hill Crest Residency** looking at two units. Unit A is a pristine 2-bedroom, 1000 sq ft apartment listed at Rs42 lakh. Unit B is spacious 3-bedroom, 1500 sq ft apartment listed at Rs56 lakh. Your budget allows for either. Which one makes financial sense?

The developer will tell you the 3BR is "better value." The rental agent will tell you the 2BR "rents faster." The data tells a more nuanced story that depends entirely on your investment horizon.

## The Rental Market Realities

Karachi apartment rental yields average 6.21%—one of Pakistan's highest. But that number masks critical variation by apartment size:

**2 Bedroom Apartments (1000 sq ft):**
- Average monthly rent: Rs28,000-35,000
- Rental yield: 6.8-7.4% on Rs42-50 lakh purchase
- Vacancy rate: 8-12% (most marketable)
- Average vacancy duration: 15-20 days between tenants
- Tenant profiles: Young professionals, small families, corporate executives
- Tenant stability: 70% renew annual contracts

**3 Bedroom Apartments (1500 sq ft):**
- Average monthly rent: Rs38,000-48,000
- Rental yield: 8.1-9.2% on Rs50-65 lakh purchase
- Vacancy rate: 16-22% (less marketable)
- Average vacancy duration: 45-60 days between tenants
- Tenant profiles: Large families, business owners, diplomatic staff
- Tenant stability: 55% renew annual contracts

**The uncomfortable truth:** A 3BR apartment yields 12-15% more monthly rent. But vacancies last 3x longer, tenant turnover is 25% higher, and maintenance calls per vacancy are 40% more frequent.

Over a 10-year holding period, 2BR generates more consistent income because it spends more months occupied by higher-retention tenants.

## The Cost of Waiting for Tenants

Let's calculate real numbers:

**2-Bedroom Unit (Rs42 Lakh, Rs30,000/month rent):**
- 10-year rent collected (assuming 85% occupancy): Rs3.06 lakh
- Maintenance/vacancy costs: Rs18,000/year × 10 = Rs1.8 lakh
- Net rental income: Rs1.26 lakh
- Effective yield: 7.1%

**3-Bedroom Unit (Rs56 Lakh, Rs42,000/month rent):**
- 10-year rent collected (assuming 70% occupancy due to longer vacancies): Rs3.528 lakh
- Maintenance/vacancy costs: Rs28,000/year × 10 = Rs2.8 lakh
- Net rental income: Rs728,000
- Effective yield: 6.4%

**Despite higher rent, the 3BR's effective yield is 10% lower because vacancy duration compounds.**

According to Apna DHA market analysis, properties vacated for 60+ days require 8,000-12,000 in maintenance costs (stale odors, mold growth, minor repairs from disuse). A 2BR vacated for 20 days costs Rs1,500-2,000. The vacancy itself becomes expensive.

## The Resale Value Question

This is where size matters differently:

**2-Bedroom Resale:**
- Target buyers: First-time homeowners, young professionals, investors seeking rental income
- Market liquidity: Very high (easiest to sell quickly)
- Price appreciation: 7-9% annually (in good markets)
- Selling timeframe: 2-4 weeks to close

**3-Bedroom Resale:**
- Target buyers: Families, business owners, employers seeking employee housing
- Market liquidity: Lower (slower to sell, more negotiation)
- Price appreciation: 6-8% annually
- Selling timeframe: 6-12 weeks to close

Resale velocity matters. A 2BR apartment appreciating 8% annually and selling in 4 weeks is more liquid than a 3BR appreciating 6% and taking 8 weeks to sell. If you ever need emergency liquidity, the 2BR provides it faster.

According to Graana.com's 2025 resale analysis, **2 bedroom apartments in Bahria Town** have a 2-3 week average time-on-market. **3 bedroom apartments** average 6-8 weeks. That translates to carrying costs: 30 extra days of mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance while waiting for the right buyer.

## The Family vs Investment Decision

This is really the fundamental choice:

**Buy 2BR if:**
- You're primarily seeking rental income (not a future home for yourself)
- You want maximum tenant turnover flexibility
- You need quick resale options
- You have limited capital for down payments
- You expect to sell within 7-10 years

**Buy 3BR if:**
- You're planning to live in it eventually (your own home)
- You're betting on family-oriented long-term appreciation
- You can absorb longer vacancies (strong cash reserves)
- You want a property that grows with your family
- You expect to hold beyond 10 years

## The Maintenance Cost Factor

Operating costs differ significantly:

**2-Bedroom Monthly Costs:**
- HOA/maintenance: Rs3,500-4,200
- Utilities: Rs3,000-4,000
- Repair reserve: Rs1,000
- Insurance: Rs800-1,000
- Total: Rs8,300-10,200

**3-Bedroom Monthly Costs:**
- HOA/maintenance: Rs5,200-6,500 (larger unit)
- Utilities: Rs4,500-5,500 (more rooms, higher consumption)
- Repair reserve: Rs1,500 (larger area, more systems)
- Insurance: Rs1,200-1,500
- Total: Rs12,400-15,000

**The 3BR costs 45-50% more to operate monthly.** If your tenant doesn't cover those costs in rent, you're subsidizing occupancy.

## The Math For Different Budgets

**Budget: Rs40 Lakh (Down payment Rs8L, financing Rs32L)**

**Option A: 2BR apartment at Rs42 Lakh**
- Monthly loan: Rs21,000
- Monthly operating costs: Rs9,200
- Required rent: Rs30,200 minimum
- Market rent: Rs30,000-32,000
- Profit margin: Rs500-2,800/month (razor-thin)

**Option B: Can't afford 3BR (Rs56L) with this budget**

**Verdict: Must buy 2BR; 3BR is financially risky**

---

**Budget: Rs50 Lakh (Down payment Rs10L, financing Rs40L)**

**Option A: 2BR apartment at Rs48 Lakh**
- Monthly loan: Rs26,300
- Monthly operating costs: Rs9,200
- Required rent: Rs35,500
- Market rent: Rs32,000-34,000
- Profit margin: Negative to break-even (not ideal for investors)

**Option B: 3BR apartment at Rs56 Lakh**
- Monthly loan: Rs36,700
- Monthly operating costs: Rs13,500
- Required rent: Rs50,200
- Market rent: Rs42,000-45,000
- Profit margin: Negative to break-even

**Verdict: Neither size works well for pure investment; buying one for personal use makes more sense**

---

**Budget: Rs65 Lakh (Down payment Rs13L, financing Rs52L)**

**Option A: 2BR apartment at Rs62 Lakh**
- Monthly loan: Rs34,150
- Monthly operating costs: Rs9,200
- Required rent: Rs43,350
- Market rent: Rs35,000-38,000
- Profit margin: Negative (2BR won't rent high enough)

**Option B: 3BR apartment at Rs65 Lakh**
- Monthly loan: Rs42,700
- Monthly operating costs: Rs13,500
- Required rent: Rs56,200
- Market rent: Rs45,000-50,000
- Profit margin: Negative to Rs6,000/month (workable for investors)

**Verdict: 3BR starts making investment sense at this budget level**

## The Breakeven Analysis

For pure rental investment to be profitable, you need rent to exceed: (monthly loan + operating costs) × 1.15 (15% buffer for vacancies, repairs, tenant issues).

**2BR breakeven rent: Rs32,000-35,000** → Market provides this ✅
**3BR breakeven rent: Rs55,000-58,000** → Market provides Rs42,000-48,000 ❌

Mathematically, **2 bedroom apartments in Bahria Town** work better as rental investments because market rents cover costs with profit margin. **3 bedroom apartments** work better as owner-occupied homes or long-term family holds.

## The Strategic Recommendation

**For investors with Rs40-50L capital:**
Buy a 2BR. Rent it out. Use cash flow to save for a second property. Build a portfolio of 2BR units that reliably generate 6-7% yield. Higher yield + faster turnover + easier resale = better investor economics.

**For buyers planning to live in it:**
Buy the 3BR if you have **family-sized budget (Rs65L+)**. Don't finance a 3BR for investment purposes unless you're willing to absorb negative cash flow for 5+ years betting on appreciation.

**For first-time buyers seeking affordability:**
Buy the 2BR. You get flexibility (rent it out if life changes), decent yield (6-7%), and genuine resale liquidity.
