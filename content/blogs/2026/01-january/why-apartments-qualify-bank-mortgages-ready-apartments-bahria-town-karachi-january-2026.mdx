A young professional earning Rs90,000 monthly walks into HBL asking about mortgage approval. Five years ago: automatic rejection. "Your income doesn't qualify for this loan size."

Today, the same professional gets pre-approved for a Rs40 lakh mortgage within 48 hours.

The difference isn't the professional's income. It's the system. Pakistan's government established the Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC) specifically to solve the housing finance constraint. Banks now have liquidity backing them. Central bank policy rates dropped from 20% to 11%. Government removed withholding tax barriers.

The result: mortgage access has genuinely expanded. But it's not universal. Some apartments qualify for bank financing. Others don't. The difference determines whether you're paying cash or getting 80% financed.

## What Changed: The Mortgage Infrastructure

**December 2025:** PMRC organized "Unlocking Housing Finance Potential" roundtable conference. Banks, builders, government officials, and regulators aligned on a single goal: increase mortgage financing from 8% of new home purchases to 30% by 2028.

To make that happen:

1. **PMRC provided Rs100 billion liquidity facility** for banks to refinance mortgages
2. **SBP progressively cut policy rate** from 20% → 11%
3. **Federal Budget 2025-26 cut withholding tax** (4% → 2.5% on primary transaction)
4. **Major banks expanded approval criteria:**
   - HBL: Now approving Rs2M-10M mortgages for salaried professionals
   - Meezan Bank: Launched "Easy Home" with 85% LTV (loan-to-value)
   - Bank of Punjab: Competitive rates for first-time buyers
   - Habib Bank: Fast-track approval for developer properties

The bottleneck wasn't "people don't want mortgages." It was "banks can't afford to lend at 20% interest rates."

Now they can. Now they do.

## The Bank Approval Requirements

Here's what banks actually require to approve mortgage financing:

**Income Requirements:**
- Minimum monthly income: Rs80,000 (varies by bank)
- Income stability: 2+ years employment history (salaried or self-employed with audited accounts)
- Debt-to-income ratio: Maximum 35-40% (total monthly debt obligations ÷ gross monthly income)

**Property Requirements:**
- Property must be **ready or near-completion** (not under-construction)
- Developer must be bank-approved (list of 30-40 major developers)
- Property must have independent valuation (bank hires appraiser)
- Property must be registered (to become mortgage collateral)

**Down Payment Requirements:**
- Standard: 20% (you pay, bank finances 80%)
- First-time buyers: 15-20% (some banks offering 15% to incentivize new buyers)
- Salaried professionals: 20-25% standard

**Approval Timeline:**
- Initial pre-approval: 2-5 business days
- Full documentation: 7-14 days
- Property valuation: 5-7 days
- Final approval: 3-5 business days
- **Total: 20-30 days from application to mortgage disbursement**

## Which Apartments Qualify vs Don't

**BANKS WILL FINANCE:**

✅ **Ready apartments in Bahria Town Karachi** (most banks approve instantly)
- Reason: Developers (Narkin's Builders, other major developers) are on bank-approved list
- Reason: Properties ready for possession reduce risk
- Reason: Bahria Town location is recognized as stable asset class
- Approval rate: 95%+

✅ **Hill Crest Residency apartments** (premium approval)
- Reason: Completed, delivered, verified project
- Reason: Established rental market (banks know resale values)
- Reason: Developer with 30-year track record reduces perception of risk
- Approval rate: 98%+

✅ **Best apartments in Bahria Town Karachi** from major developers (strong approval prospects)
- Reason: Ready possession, established builder
- Reason: Located in proven investment zone
- Approval rate: 90%+

✅ **DHA Karachi apartments** (automatic approval)
- Reason: Government-backed development authority
- Reason: Standardized pricing and transparent documentation
- Approval rate: 99%+

**BANKS WILL PARTIALLY FINANCE OR REJECT:**

❌ **Under-construction apartments** (most banks reject or finance 50-60% only)
- Reason: Construction delays create liability
- Reason: Can't use property as collateral until possession
- Reason: Developer risk higher
- Approval rate: 20-30% (and only from developer-friendly banks)

❌ **Off-market developments** (small private developers not on bank list)
- Reason: Banks can't assess developer credibility
- Reason: No resale market data
- Reason: Higher foreclosure risk
- Approval rate: 5-10% (usually rejected)

❌ **Overseas Pakistani investor deals** (most banks hesitant)
- Reason: Currency risk (remittance fluctuations)
- Reason: Absentee owner complications
- Approval rate: 30-50% (requires special documentation)

❌ **Plots** (banks rarely finance)
- Reason: No collateral value until developed
- Reason: Speculative asset class
- Approval rate: <5%

## The Real Approval Process

An engineer earning Rs120,000 monthly wants to buy a **ready 2 bedroom apartment in Bahria Town** for Rs45 lakh. Here's what happens:

**Day 1-2: Pre-qualification**
- Call HBL mortgage department
- Provide: Income proof (salary certificate, last 3 months payslips), CNIC, property address
- Bank calculates: Rs45 Lakh × 80% = Rs36L mortgage needed
- Monthly payment at 10.5% over 20 years = Rs23,600
- Engineer's debt-to-income: 23,600 ÷ 120,000 = 19.7% ✅ (well below 35-40% limit)
- Bank pre-approves for Rs36 lakh

**Day 3-7: Documentation**
- Submit: Job contract, 3 months pay slips, tax returns, bank statements, property details
- Bank reviews: Financial health, employment stability, payment history
- Bank notifies: Approval pending property valuation

**Day 8-14: Property Valuation**
- Bank hires independent appraiser
- Appraiser visits property, verifies ownership, assesses condition
- Appraisal report: Rs45 Lakh (confirms market value)
- Bank clears: Property acceptable as collateral

**Day 15-20: Final Approval**
- Bank issues mortgage commitment letter
- Lawyer reviews: Loan terms, property documentation
- Agreement signed: Rs36 Lakh loan at 10.5%, 20-year term
- Down payment: Engineer pays Rs9 Lakh (20%)

**Day 21+: Disbursement & Registration**
- Bank releases Rs36 Lakh to developer/seller
- Property ownership transfers to engineer (bank holds lien/mortgage)
- Registration deed filed with Sindh Registration Authority

**Total timeline: 20-30 days from initial inquiry to funds available.**

For **easy monthly installments apartments Karachi**, this means buyers can go from "interested" to "approved" to "moving in" within 5-6 weeks.

## The Qualification Gap

Here's the painful reality: mortgage access is expanding, but it's not universal.

**Qualifiers (can easily get financing):**
- Salaried professionals with 2+ years job stability
- Income Rs80,000+ monthly
- Debt-to-income ratio below 35%
- Buying from bank-approved developers (Bahria Town, DHA, major developers)
- Buying ready or near-complete properties

**Strugglers (may face rejections):**
- Self-employed professionals without audited accounts
- Contract workers (3-month or 6-month contracts)
- Income Rs50,000-80,000 (marginal qualification)
- Existing debt (car loans, credit cards) pushing debt-to-income high
- Buying under-construction properties

**Rejecters (unlikely to qualify):**
- Income below Rs50,000
- Multiple existing loans (debt-to-income 50%+)
- Credit history issues (late payments, defaults)
- Self-employed without audited accounts
- Buying from non-bank-approved developers

## The Strategic Advantage

This mortgage expansion creates a specific advantage for buyers purchasing **ready apartments from established developers:**

You're competing only against other qualified salaried professionals. The speculative investors (who used to dominate with all-cash purchases) can't leverage mortgages for pure investment. The under-resourced families can't get financed. The market consolidates around people like you: salaried, stable, qualified.

When the buyer pool narrows to qualified borrowers, property values stabilize. No more 100% appreciation spikes (speculation-driven). No more 30% crashes (speculator exodus). Steady 7-10% annual appreciation (fundamentals-driven).

**Hill Crest Residency apartments** and **ready apartments in Bahria Town** benefit from this market consolidation. Banks approve them reliably. Buyer pool is stable and qualified. Resale is predictable because future buyers will also be financing.

## The Timeline Matters

This window—where mortgages are accessible and banks are competitive—likely lasts 18-24 months. Here's why:

If inflation re-accelerates or external pressure builds, SBP will raise rates. At 15-16% rates, bank approvals tighten again. PMRC's impact diminishes.

Buyers who qualify TODAY should move decisively. Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is free. Finding a property takes weeks. Closing takes 20-30 days. **The entire process can complete in 60-90 days if you move now.**

Buyers who wait 12 months might find rates have climbed, approvals have tightened, and their qualification has weakened (promotion cycles change, debt increases, income circumstances shift).
