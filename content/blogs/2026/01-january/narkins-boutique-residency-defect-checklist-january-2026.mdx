You've waited for possession of your dream apartment at **Narkin's Boutique Residency**, and the day has finally arrived. But before you sign the papers and move in, there's a crucial step: the inspection.

Karachi's coastal climate presents unique challenges for construction. Salt corrosion, humidity, and even heavy monsoon rains can expose underlying issues if not addressed properly during building. Accepting possession without a thorough check can turn your dream home into a costly maintenance nightmare.

This checklist covers the most common defects to look for, ensuring your **ready apartments Bahria Town Karachi** meet the quality you expect.

## Essential Inspection Points for Narkin's Boutique Residency Apartments

When you receive possession of your **Narkin's Boutique Residency apartment**, bring this list with you. Ideally, conduct the inspection during daylight hours for best visibility.

### 1. Walls & Plaster

-   **Visual Inspection:** Look for any visible cracks, especially diagonal ones originating from corners of doors or windows. Fine, hairline cracks might be normal plaster shrinkage, but wider or deeper cracks can indicate structural issues.
-   **Damp Patches:** Check walls, especially in bathrooms, kitchens, and external walls, for any signs of dampness or discoloration. This could indicate seepage from plumbing leaks or external waterproofing failures.
-   **Paint Quality:** Ensure paint is applied evenly, without bubbles, peeling, or uneven patches. Poor paint jobs can hide underlying dampness.

### 2. Plumbing & Water Drainage

-   **Tap & Shower Functionality:** Turn on all taps, showers, and flush toilets. Check water pressure and ensure hot water systems work.
-   **Leak Detection:** Inspect under sinks, around toilet bases, and behind washing machine connections for any signs of leaks.
-   **Drainage:** Run water in sinks and showers. Ensure water drains away quickly and smoothly, without pooling. Blocked drains are a common issue.
-   **Water Tank:** If accessible, check the internal condition of the water tank for cleanliness and leaks.

### 3. Electrical Systems

-   **Switch & Socket Check:** Test every light switch, fan regulator, and power socket. Ensure they are functioning correctly and securely fitted.
-   **Circuit Breaker:** Locate the main electrical panel and ensure all breakers are labeled and functional.
-   **Wiring:** Look for any exposed wires or shoddy electrical work. In **luxury apartments Bahria Town**, quality wiring and junction boxes are essential for safety.

### 4. Flooring & Tiling

-   **Levelness:** Walk across floors and tiles. They should feel level and firm underfoot.
-   **Cracks & Chips:** Inspect tiles for any cracks, chips, or loose tiles, especially in bathrooms and kitchens where they are subject to more wear and tear.
-   **Grout Lines:** Check grout lines for consistency and proper sealing. Gaps can lead to water seepage.

### 5. Doors & Windows

-   **Operation:** Open and close all doors and windows. They should slide and swing smoothly without sticking or excessive force.
-   **Sealing:** Check window seals for gaps that could allow water or air infiltration, especially important in Karachi's climate.
-   **Locks & Handles:** Ensure all door locks, handles, and latches are secure and functional.

### 6. Coastal Specific Issues (Crucial for Karachi)

-   **Salt Corrosion:** Look closely at steel elements, especially in balconies, bathrooms, and near the coast. Rust stains on concrete or visible corrosion on exposed rebar are serious issues.
-   **Waterproofing:** Check external walls and balconies for any signs of water damage, staining, or compromised waterproofing membranes. This is critical for preventing long-term structural damage.
-   **Ventilation:** Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in bathrooms and kitchens, to combat humidity and prevent mold growth.

## What If Defects Are Found?

If you discover any significant issues:
1.  **Document Everything:** Take clear photos and videos of each defect.
2.  **Notify the Developer Immediately:** Provide a written report detailing all issues.
3.  **Do Not Sign Possession:** Do not accept possession until the developer agrees to rectify the major defects. Minor cosmetic issues might be settled with a written commitment for later repair.
